Nos divertimos tanto que não percebemos que 5 horas haviam passado.</p> <p>Depois de mais de cinco anos juntos e dois gatos, Simon fez o pedido de casamento durante a nossa primeira viagem ao Brasil em 25 de setembro de 2022. Samires sabia que o pedido seria durante a viagem, mas ainda ficou surpresa, especialmente porque ele fez o pedido em português.
